Welcome to my digital space! I'm Niharika, an aspiring Software Developer. I am a driven individual when it comes to learning new things, and I use that knowledge to build cool stuff with it. What drives my passion for software development? Imagine tackling a project that first appears overwhelmingly difficult, only to break it down and discover it's entirely manageable. That moment of triumph is truly unbeatable.

In the realm of software development, I aim to bring to life the ideas I've envisioned. It's more than just coding; it's about turning imagination into reality. Join me on this thrilling journey where each line of code brings us closer to transforming dreams into real, functional creations.

 Iâ€™m currently learning backend development
 Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on developing communities and working on projects.
